# TDD Mocha Rooster

This is my first TDD script using node.js & Mocha.

## Initial Idea
Use the Mocha test framework to create a fast, complete, reliable, isolated, maintainable, and expressive test suite to ensure that the rooster is functioning correctly. In doing so this will create a form of documentation for other developers.

### Comments & Thought Process
Having spent the day learning TDD I felt that I needed something specific to test, so created a rooster function and then tried to create a test script using Mocha. It's pretty fun and intuitive - going in I kind of had this impression that automated testing would be this big thing that would be quite hard... but it turns out it's fairly straight forward!

I do feel the syntax could be a little bit clearer, but that's offset because you can include so much string text to explain what is going on; so overall I quite like it and I can see the strategic benefit of using TDD as a primary method of developing software.
